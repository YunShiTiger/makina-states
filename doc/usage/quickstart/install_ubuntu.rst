Install LXC makina-states on ubuntu with upstart
===========================================================

Install lxc
--------------
Official doc: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html

First install LXC
::

 sudo apt-get install lxc

Prepare network connectivity
-------------------------------
In makina-states, our images are known to use a network bridge called
``lxcbr1``.

They use the ``10.5/16`` network and ``10.5.0.1`` as the default gateway.

For this to work, you have plenty of solutions.

Network bridge
----------------
The first thing you ll have to do is to persist the network bridge.
For this, on ubuntu, the simpliest thing is to inspire ourselves from the
default lxc-net configuration and create the following configuration file

First, create **as root** this upstart job ``/etc/init/lxc-net-makina.conf``::

    curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makinacorpus/makina-states/stable/files/gen/etc/init/lxc-net-makina.conf >> /etc/init/lxc-net-makina.conf
    chmod 644 lxc-net-makina.conf

Don't forget that you can read the upstart job but basically, it creates the bridge and then masquerade the outband traffic.

Then reload it with::

    service lxc-net-makina restart

You will see you newly created bridge with::

    # ip addr show dev lxcbr1

Activate kernel forwarding
---------------------------
Please follow :ref:`activate_forwarding`.

Install the image
-------------------
You can now read and proceed with the following section, :ref:`install_lxc_template`.

Note about firewalling
------------------------
Last but not least,  if you use a firewall, and we hope you do so, please refer to the firewalling section for further configuration. Please read :ref:`lxc_firewall`.

On ubuntu you may be using:

    - :ref:`install_lxc_ufw`
    - :ref:`install_lxc_shorewall`
