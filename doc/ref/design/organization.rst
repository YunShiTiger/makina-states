Main states kind segregation
=============================
Overview
--------
In makina states we have organised our states in the following way:

    :controllers: states related to the base salt infrastructure (layout, deamons, permissions)
    :nodetypes: states related only to the hardware, the machine type  or virtualisation facillity
    :localsettings: states related to the base machine configuration minus all that can looks like a service or a deamon (eg: directories creations, hosts managment, pam, vim but not ssh)
    :services: states related to services configuration (eg: ssh, docker, apache, backups scripts & crons)
    :projects: Set of macros to be externallly included project consumers as the base to setup their projects using makina-states bricks
    :cloud: set of related stuff linked to mastersalt salt cloud integration

For all those kinds, we have execution modules, sub-execution modules and formulaes containers. to leverage and factorize all variables and have well placed macros.

For exemple, php users will certainly have to deal the following files:

    :mc_states/modules/services.py: registries
    :mc_states/services/{http,php}/\*.sls: states files (formulaes)
    :/srv/pillar/foo.sls: custom settings
