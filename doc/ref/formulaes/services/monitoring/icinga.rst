Icinga configuration
====================

See :ref:`module_mc_icinga` for configuration options.

The icinga module can provide:

  - configuration of icinga core
  - configuration of database for ido2db
  - configuration of ido2db daemon
  - configuration of uwsgi in order to serve cgi
  - configuration of nginx to serve cgi through uwsgi


The icinga_web module can provide:

  - configuration of icinga web
  - configuration of database for icinga web
  - configuration of php-fpm
  - configuration of nginx to serve php webpages through php-fpm

icinga_web module can configure its nginx virtualhost to serve cgi but icinga_web module doesn't configure uwsgi and doesn't install any file related to cgi.

The reason is to keep icinga and icinga_web independants.
icinga-web and icinga can be installed on two differents hosts but CGI files require to have icinga-core installed on the host.

icinga_web module depends on icinga module only if cgi is enabled in icinga-web virtualhost (makina-states.services.monitoring.icinga_web.nginx.icinga_cgi.enabled is set to True).

The mysql configuration doesn't work.
