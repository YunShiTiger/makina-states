Localsettings
=============
Those formulaes will configure basic configuration on your host that is/are not tied to a service

For example; writing something in /etc is a good catch for a localsettings states

We let the user have a word on the final local settings which are activated
This can be customized by putting keys either in pillar or in grains
in the form: 'makina-states.localsettings.<statename>'

EG: to disable the default vim configuration, either set a grain or a pillar value::

    makina-states.localsettings.vim: False
