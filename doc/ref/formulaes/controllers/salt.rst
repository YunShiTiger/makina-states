Salt
===============

To configure all salt daemons including at least a minion and certainly a master, we have three states files

    :`salt`_: install the base salt filesystem layout and files
    :`salt_master`_: configure a salt master daemon
    :`salt_minion`_: configure a salt minion daemon

All those states files have a **-standalone** variant that let us redo a light reconfiguration upon highstates to take less time but with enought configuration to let us assume that the installation is sufficiently correct.

All those formulaes are thin wrappers to the `salt_macro`_.
