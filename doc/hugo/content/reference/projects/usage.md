        services](https://github.com/makinacorpus/makina-states/tree/master/services)

## Specifications
- See the original specification &lt;project\_corpus&gt;, and specially
  the layout &lt;project\_spec\_layout&gt;, the
  install &lt;project\_spec\_proc\_install&gt; procedure, and the
  fixperms&lt;project\_spec\_proc\_fixperms&gt; procedure.
- A good sumup of the spec is as follow, but please read it once...
    -   There is a separate repo distributed along the project named
        **pillar** to store configuration variables, passwords and so on.
    -   Projects are deployed via instructions based on saltstack which
        are contained into the **.salt** folder inside the codebase.
- The deployment includes global phases in this order:
    -   archive `archive.sls`
    -   sync code from remotes if there are remotes
    -   sync/install custom salt modules (exec, states, etc) from the
        codebase if any
    -   fixperms (`fixperms.sls`)
    -   install (`install.sls`)
    -   fixperms
    -   rollback (`rollback.sls`)if error
- Some of those phases can be edited via the user, and some other not
  (install, & sync steps).
- That will explain that in your **.salt** folder, you have at least
  `install.sls`, `fixperms.sls`, `rollback.sls`, and for old projects
  `notify.sls`.
- All other sls found at **toplevel** which are not those ones are
  executed in lexicographical order (alphanum) and the convention is to
  name them `\d\d\d_NAME.sls`
- The `PILLAR.sample` file contains default configuration variable for
  your project and helps you to know what variable to override in your
  custom pillar.

### Initialization
-   a project in corpus / makina-states is a git repository checkout
    which contains the code and a well known saltstack based procedure
    to deploy it from end to end in the **.salt** folder.
-   By default the project procedure is done via a [masterless salt
    call](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/quickstart.html).
-   The first thing to do is to create a **nest** from such a project,
    **IF IT IS NOT ALREADY DONE** (just ls /srv/projects to check):

    ```sh
   bin/salt-call --retcode-passthrough mc_project.deploy <project_name> # dont be long, dont use - & _
    ```

-   This empty structure respects the aforementioned corpus reactor
    anatomy, and is just an useless helloword project which should look
    like:

        /srv/projects/<project_name>
            |
            |- pillar/init.sls: override values in PILLAR.sample and define
            |                   any other arbitrary pillar DATA.
            |
            |- data/: anything which is persisted to disk must live here
            |         from drupal sites/default/files, python eggs, buildouts parts,
            |         gems cache, sqlite files, static files, docroots, etc.
            |
            |- project/ <- a checkout or your project
            |   |-  .git
            |   |-  codebase
            |   |-  .salt
            |     |- _modules : custom salt python exec modules
            |     |- _states  : custom salt python states modules
            |     |- _runners : custom salt python runners modules
            |     |- _sdb     : custom salt python sdb modules
            |     |- _...
            |     |
            |     |- PILLAR.sample
            |     |- task_foo.sls
            |     |- 00_deploy.sls
            |
            [ If "remote_less" is False (default)
            |- git/project.git: bare git repos synchronnized (bi-directional)
            |                   with project/ used by git push style deployment
            |- git/pillar.git:  bare git repos synchronnized (bi-directional)
                                with pillar/ used by git push style deployment

-   What you want to do is to replace the `project` folder by your repo.
    This one contains your code, as asual, plus the **.salt** folder,
-   **WELL Understand** what is :
    -   a [salt
        SLS](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html#moving-beyond-a-single-sls)
        , it is the nerve of the war.
    -   the [Pillar of
        salt](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html).
-   **be ware**, on the production server the `.git/config` is linked
    with the makina-states machinery and you cannot replace it blindly,
    you must use git foo to do it.
-   Ensure to to have at least in your project git folder:
    -   `.salt/PILLAR.sample`: configuration default values to use in
        SLSes
    -   `.salt/archive.sls`: archive step
    -   `.salt/fixperms.sls`: fixperm step
    -   `.salt/rollback.sls`: rollback step
-   You can then add as many SLSes as you want, and the ones directly in
    **.salt** will be executed in alphabetical order except the ones
    beginning with **task\_** (task\_foo.sls). Indeed the ones beginning
    with **task\_** are different beasts and are intended to be either
    included by your other slses to factor code out or to be executed
    manually via the `mc_project.run_task` command.
-   You can and must have a look for inspiration on
    projects\_project\_list

## Deploying, two ways of doing things
- To build and deploy your project we provide two styles of doing style
  that should be appropriate for most use cases.
- The common workflow is:
    -   use `mc_project.init_project` to create the structure to host your
        project
    -   use `mc_project.report` to verify things are in place
    -   git push/or edit then push the pillar
        `/srv/projects/<project>/pillar` to configure the project
    -   git push/or edit then push the code inside
        `/srv/projects/<project>/project`
    -   launch the deploy
    -   Wash, Rince, Repeat

### mc\_project.init\_project: initialize the layout

The following command is the nerve of the war:

   bin/salt-call --retcode-passthrough \
        -lall \
        mc_project.init_project $project [remote_less=false/true]

-   `--local -lall` instructs to run in masterless mode and extra
    verbosity
-   `mc_project.init_project $project` instructs to create the layout of
    the name `$project` project living into
    `/srv/projects/$project/project`
-   (opt) `remote_less` instructs to deploy with or without the git
    repos that allow users to use (or not) a **git push to prod to
    deploy** workflow.

    > -   If `remote_less=true`, the git repos wont be created, and you
    >     wont be able to push to git remotes to deploy your project
    >     (you ll have to do it directly on the server, by
    >     the hand procedure &lt;project\_hand\_procedure&gt;.
    > -   If `remote_less=false`, you ll also be able to use
    >     the push to prod feature &lt;project\_git\_push\_procedure&gt;.

### mc\_project.deploy, the main entry point

The following command is the nerve of the war:

   bin/salt-call --retcode-passthrough \
        -lall \
        mc_project.deploy $project\
         [only=step2[,step1]] \
         [only_steps=step2[,step1]]

-   `--local -lall` instructs to run in masterless mode and extra
    verbosity
-   `mc_project.deploy $project` instructs to deploy the name `$project`
    project living into `/srv/projects/$project/project`
-   (opt) `only` instructs to execute only the named global phases, and
    when deploying directly onto a machine, you will certainly have to
    use `only=install,fixperms,sync_modules` to avoid the
    archive/sync/rollback steps.
-   (opt) `only_steps` instruct to execute only a specific or multiple
    specific sls from the **.salt** folder during the **install** phase.

### Directly on the remote server, by hand

Either directly from the deployment host as root:

Initialise the layout (only the first time)

```sh
ssh root@remoteserver
export project="foo"
salt-call mc_project.init_project $project
```

Edit the pillar

```sh
ssh root@remoteserver
export project="foo"
cd /srv/projects/$project
# maybe you want to edit before pillar deploy
$ÃŠDITOR pillar/init.sls
cd pillar;git commit -m foo;git push;cd ..
```

Update the project code base from git

```sh
ssh root@remoteserver
export project="foo"
cd /srv/projects/$project/project
# if not already done, add your project repo remote
git remote add g https://github.com/o/myproject.git
# in any cases, update your code
git fetch --all
git reset --hard remotes/g/<the branch to deploy>
git push --force origin HEAD:master
```

Launch deploy

```sh
ssh root@remoteserver
# launch the deployment
export project="foo"
salt-call \
    mc_project.deploy $project \
    only=install,fixperms,sync_modules
# or to deploy only a specific sls
salt-call \
    mc_project.deploy $project \
    only=install,fixperms,sync_modules only_steps=000_foo.sls
git push o HEAD:<master> # replace master by the branch you want to push
                         # back onto your forge
```

#### VARIANT: Deploy by hand, on a vagrant VM

We generally setup environments based on
[makina-states/vms](https://github.com/makinacorpus/vms) that we share
amongst our developers.

In development, our best practises are not to pull from our private git
repositories directly from inside the VM.

The HOST on which the virtualbox is running, is on the contrary
controlled by the developer and it's more safe to pull/push the code
from here.

To sum up, any **git push/pull** operation has to be done **from the
localhost** and not the vm.

In other words, the HOST can access any of the VM files with the help of
a shared **sshfs** mountpoint `./VM`. And the HOST can also access the
outside repositories. So the host in the interface that will push code
inside the VM.

This setup involves using the `remote_less` feature of `mc_project`
where we do not deploy via a `git push` nor use `archive/rollback`
mechanims.

- Initialise/launch a
  [makina-states/vms](https://github.com/makinacorpus/vms) box (this will
  take some time, specially the first time)

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/makinacorpus/vms
    cd vms
    ./manage.sh init
    ```

- Open one console connected to the VM as **root**

    ```sh
    ./manage.sh ssh
    sudo su # (default password: vagrant)
    ```

- Initialise the layout (only the first time)

    ```sh
    ssh root@remoteserver
    export project="foo"
    salt-call mc_project.init_project $project remote_less=true
    ```

- Edit the pillar

    ```sh
    cd /srv/projects/$project/pillar
    $EDITOR init.sls
    git commit -am up
    ```

- Open a second shell, on your local machine ( **not on the VM** ) where
  you ll update the project code base from git.

    ```sh
    export project="foo"
    cd vms/VM/srv/projects/$project/project
    # if not already done, add your project repo remote
    git remote add o https://github.com/o/myproject.git
    # in any cases, update your code
    git fetch --all
    git reset --hard remotes/o/<the branch to deploy>
    ```

- On the former shell ssh-connected to the vagrant box, launch deploy

    ```sh
    salt-call mc_project.deploy $project only=install,fixperms,sync_modules
    # or to deploy only a specific sls
    salt-call \
        mc_project.deploy $project \
        only=install,fixperms,sync_modules only_steps=000_foo.sls
    ```

- When you want to commit your changes, return to the second shell, on
  your local machine

    ```sh
    export project="foo"
    cd vms/VM/srv/$project/project
    git push o HEAD:<master> # replace master by the branch you want to push
                             # back onto your forge
    ```

### Deploy with git instructions

#### Reminder

-   **WARNING**: you can use it only if you provisionned your project
    with attached remotes (the default)
-   Remember use the remotes inside `/srv/projects/<project>/git` and
    not directly the working copies
-   If you push on the pillar, it does not trigger a deploy
-   If you push on the project, it triggers the full deploy procedure
    including archive/sync/rollback.
-   To get useful push informations, on the remote server to deploy to,
    just do

```sh
salt-call -lall mc_project.report
```

#### Deploy

The following lines edit the pillar, and push it, this does not trigger
a deploy

```sh
cd $WORKSPACE/myproject
git clone host:/srv/projects/project/git/pillar.git
$EDITOR pillar/init.sls
cd pillar;git commit -am up;git push;cd ..
```

The following lines prepare a clone of your project codebase to be able
to be deployed onto production or staging servers

```sh
cd $WORKSPACE/myproject
git clone git@github.com/makinacorpus/myawsomeproject.git
git remote add prod /srv/projects/project/git/project.git
git fetch --all
```

To trigger a remote deployment, now you can do:

```sh
git push [--force] prod <mybranch>:master
eg: git push [--force] prod <mybranch>:master
eg: git push [--force] prod awsome_feature:master
```

- **REMINDER**:
    -   DONT MESS WITH THE **ORIGIN** REMOTE when your are connected
        to your server in any of the `pillar` or
        `project` directory..
    -   The `<branchname>:master` is really important as everything
        in the production git repositories is wired on the `master`
        branch. You can push any branch you want from your original
            repository, but in production, there is only **master**.

### Sumup
- To sum all that up, when beginning project you will:
    -   Initialize if not done a project structure with
        `salt-call mc_project.init_project project`
    -   If you do not want git remotes, you can alternativly use
        `salt-call mc_project.init_project project remote_less=true`
    -   add a **.salt** folder alongside your project codebase (in it's
        git repo).
    -   deploy it, either by:
        -   git push your **pillar** files to
            `host:/srv/projects/<project>/git/pillar.git`
        -   git push your **project code** to
            `host:/srv/projects/<project>/git/project.git` (this last push
            triggers a deploy on the remote server)
        -   Your can use `--force` as the deploy system only await the
            `.salt` folder. As long as the folder is present of the
            working copy you are sending, the deploy system will be happy.
-   or connected to the remote host to deploy onto
    -   edit/commit/push in `host:/srv/projects/<project>/pillar`
    -   edit/commit/push/push to force in
        `host:/srv/projects/<project>`
    -   Launch the
        `salt-call mc_project.deploy <name> only=install,fixperms,sync_modules`
        dance
-   Wash, Rince, Repeat

### Configuration pillar & variables
- We provide in **mc\_project** a powerfull mecanism to define default
  variables used in your deployments. hat you can safely override in the
  salt pillar files. This means that you can set some default values for,
  eg a domain name or a password, and input the production values that you
  won't commit along side your project codebase.
    -   Default values have to be stored inside the **PILLAR.sample** file.
    -   Some of those variables, the one at the first level are mostly read
        only and setup by makina-states itself. The most important are:
        -   `name`: project name
        -   `user`: the system user of your project
        -   `group`: the system group of your project
        -   `data`: top level free variables mapping
        -   `project_root`: project root absolute path
        -   `data_root`: persistent folder absolute path
        -   `default_env`: environment (staging/prod/dev)
        -   `pillar_root`: absolute path to the pillar
        -   `fqdn`: machine FQDN
    -   The only variables that you can edit at the first level are:
        -   **remote\_less**: is this project using git remotes for
            triggering deployments
        -   **default\_env**: environement (valid values
            are staging/dev/prod)
        -   **env\_defaults**: indexed by **env** dict that overloads data
            (pillar will still have the priority)
        -   **os\_defaults**: indexed by **os** dict that overloads data
            (pillar will still have the priority)
    -   The other variables, members of the **data** sub entry are free for
        you to add/edit.
    -   Any thing in the pillar `pillar/init.sls` overloads what is in
        `project/.salt/PILLAR.sample`.

- You can get and consult the result of the configuration assemblage like
  this:

      ```sh
      bin/salt-call --retcode-passthrough mc_project.get_configuration <project_name>
      ```

-   Remember that projects have a name, and the pillar key to configure
    and overload your project configuration is based on this key.

    If your project is name **foo**, you ll have to use
    **makina-projects.foo** in place of **makina-projects.example**.

Example

in `project/.salt/PILLAR.sample`, you have:

```yaml
makina-projects.projectname:
  data:
    start_cmd: 'myprog'
```

in `pillar/init.sls`, you have:

``yaml
makina-projects.foo:
   data:
     start_cmd: 'myprog2'
```

-   In your states files, you can access the configuration via the magic
    `opts.ms_project` variable.
-   In your modules or file templates, you can access the configuration
    via `salt['mc_project.get_configuration'(name)`.
-   A tip for loading the configuration from a template is doing
    something like that:

```yaml
# project/.salt/00_deploy.sls
{% set cfg = opts.ms_project %}
toto:
  file.managed:
      - name: "source://makina-projects/{{cfg.name}}/files/etc/foo"
      - target: /etc/foo
      - user {{cfg.user}}
      - group {{cfg.user}}
      - defaults:
          project: {{cfg.name}}

# project/.salt/files/etc/foo
{% set cfg = opts.ms_project %}
My Super Template of {{cfg.name}} will run {{cfg.data.start_cmd}}
```

## What's happen when there is a deploy ?
-   When you do a git push, you have the full procedure, see
    spec doc &lt;project\_spec\_deploy\_proc&gt;
-   When you use `only=install,fixperms,sync_modules` it only do some
    the install &lt;project\_spec\_proc\_install&gt; &
    fixperms &lt;project\_spec\_proc\_fixperms&gt; procedures.

## SaltStack integration
- As you know in makina-states, there are 2 concurrent salt installs, one
  for **salt**, the one that you use, and one for **mastersalt** for the
  devil ops. In makina-states, we use by default:
    -   a virtualenv inside `/salt-venv/salt`
    -   [salt from a fork](https://github.com/makina-corpus/salt.git)
        installed inside `/salt-venv/salt/src/salt`
    -   the salt file root resides, as usual, in `/srv/salt`
    -   the salt pillar root resides, as usual, in `/srv/pillar`
    -   the salt configuration root resides, as usual, in `/etc/salt`

- As you see, the project layout seems not integration on those following
  folders, but in fact, the project initialisation routines made symlinks
  to integrate it which look like:

    - /srv/salt/makina-projects/<project_name>>  -> /srv/projects/<project_name>/projectÂ§/.salt
    - /srv/pillar/makina-projects/<project_name> -> /srv/projects/<project_name>/pillar

-   The pillar is auto included in the **pillar top**
    (`/srv/pÃ®llar/top.sls`).
-   The project salt files are not and **must not** be included in the
    salt **top** for further highstates unless you know what you
    are doing.

- You can unlink your project from salt with:

   ```sh
   bin/salt-call --retcode-passthrough mc_project.unlink <project_name>
   ```

- You can link project from salt with:

   ```sh
   bin/salt-call --retcode-passthrough mc_project.link <project_name>
   ```
