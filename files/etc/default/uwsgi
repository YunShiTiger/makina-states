# If 'no', then init.d script prints one-character symbols instead file names.

# Printing confnames is quite informative, but could mess terminal output or
# be somewhat dangerous (as filename could contain arbitary characters).
# ASCII control characters in file names are replaced with '?' in init.d script
# output, nevertheless you were warned.
